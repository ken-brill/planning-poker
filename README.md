# Planning Poker

Welcome to the Planning Poker repository! This project offers a fun and interactive way for Agile teams to estimate user stories during sprint planning sessions.

## 🎯 What is Planning Poker?

Planning Poker, also known as Scrum Poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique used to estimate the effort or relative size of development goals in software development. citeturn0search12

In this game:

- Each team member privately selects an estimation value using a deck of cards.
- The selected values are revealed simultaneously, fostering discussion and convergence.
- Repeat until a consensus is reached for each user story.
